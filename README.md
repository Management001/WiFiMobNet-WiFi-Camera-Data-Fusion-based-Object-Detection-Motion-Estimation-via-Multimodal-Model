# WiFiMobNet-WiFi-Camera-Data-Fusion-based-Object-Detection-Motion-Estimation-via-Multimodal-Model

* This repository is a part of a WiFi signal-based human detection and motion estimation project in initial phase.
* The goal of our research is to develop technology to recognize and track objects beyond walls utilizing WiFi signals in the IEEE standards.
* Our data-pair acquition toolkit was uploaded on [IEEE-802.11n-CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO/IEEE-802.11n-CSI-Camera-Synchronization-Toolkit).

* Finally, we plan to "*multiple edge-based federated multi-modal approachs*" to expand this project with [Prof. Ramesh Rao](https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=l-WGj3AAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao) from [Qualcomm institue](https://qi.ucsd.edu/about/leadership/).
